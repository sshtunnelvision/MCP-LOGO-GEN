Logo Generation and Background Removal Process

1. Generate Logo Image
   - Use generate_image
   - The response will contain a URL to the generated image
   - pass the url to the remove_background tool

2. Remove Background
   - use remove_background
   - Input: URL from the generated image
   - The response will contain a new URL with the background-removed version

3. Download Final Image
   - Take the URL from the background removal step
   - Download to a local directory (e.g., 'downloads')
   - The final image will have a transparent background

   4. Create Scaled Versions
   - Take the downloaded image
   - Create 32x32 and 128x128 versions
   - Save alongside the original in the downloads directory
   - All versions maintain transparency


Notes:
- All steps require a valid FAL AI API key
- The process is sequential - each step depends on the previous step's output
- Final image format will be PNG to preserve transparency
- Original generated images are typically webp format
- Background-removed images are automatically converted to PNG
